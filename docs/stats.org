** Tap Aggregated Stats

Aggregated tap stats allow named tap connections to be logically
grouped and aggregated together by prefixes.

For example, if all of your tap connections started with =rebalance_=
or =replication_=, you could call =stats tapagg _= to request stats
grouped by everything before the first =_= character, giving you a set
for =rebalance= and a set for =replication=.

| [prefix]:qlen               | Total length of queues with this prefix    |

** Dcp Stats

Each stat begins with =ep_dcpq:= followed by a unique /client_id/ and
another colon.  For example, if your client is named, =slave1=, the
=created= stat would be =ep_dcpq:slave1:created=.

** Dcp Aggregated Stats

Aggregated dcp stats allow dcp connections to be logically grouped and
aggregated together by prefixes.

For example, if all of your dcp connections started with =xdcr:= or
=replication=, you could call =stats dcpagg := to request stats grouped by
everything before the first =:= character, giving you a set for =xdcr= and a
set for =replication=.

** Timing Stats

Timing stats provide histogram data from high resolution timers over
various operations within the system.

*** General Form

As this data is multi-dimensional, some parsing may be required for
machine processing.  It's somewhat human readable, but the =stats=
script mentioned in the Getting Started section above will do fancier
formatting for you.

Consider the following sample stats:

: STAT disk_insert_8,16 9488
: STAT disk_insert_16,32 290
: STAT disk_insert_32,64 73
: STAT disk_insert_64,128 86
: STAT disk_insert_128,256 48
: STAT disk_insert_256,512 2
: STAT disk_insert_512,1024 12
: STAT disk_insert_1024,2048 1

This tells you that =disk_insert= took 8-16µs 9,488 times, 16-32µs
290 times, and so on.

The same stats displayed through the =stats= CLI tool would look like
this:

: disk_insert (10008 total)
:    8us - 16us    : ( 94.80%) 9488 ###########################################
:    16us - 32us   : ( 97.70%)  290 #
:    32us - 64us   : ( 98.43%)   73
:    64us - 128us  : ( 99.29%)   86
:    128us - 256us : ( 99.77%)   48
:    256us - 512us : ( 99.79%)    2
:    512us - 1ms   : ( 99.91%)   12
:    1ms - 2ms     : ( 99.92%)    1

** Hash Stats

Hash stats provide information on your vbucket hash tables.

Requesting these stats does affect performance, so don't do it too
regularly, but it's useful for debugging certain types of performance
issues.  For example, if your hash table is tuned to have too few
buckets for the data load within it, the =max_depth= will be too large
and performance will suffer.

| avg_count    | The average number of items per vbucket                  |
| avg_max      | The average max depth of a vbucket hash table            |
| avg_min      | The average min depth of a vbucket hash table            |
| largest_max  | The largest hash table depth of in all vbuckets          |
| largest_min  | The the largest minimum hash table depth of all vbuckets |
| max_count    | The largest number of items in a vbucket                 |
| min_count    | The smallest number of items in a vbucket                |
| total_counts | The total numer of items in all vbuckets                 |

It is also possible to get more detailed hash tables stats by using
'hash detail'. This will print per-vbucket stats.

Each stat is prefixed with =vb_= followed by a number, a colon, then
the individual stat name.

For example, the stat representing the size of the hash table for
vbucket 0 is =vb_0:size=.

| state            | The current state of this vbucket                |
| size             | Number of hash buckets                           |
| locks            | Number of locks covering hash table operations   |
| min_depth        | Minimum number of items found in a bucket        |
| max_depth        | Maximum number of items found in a bucket        |
| reported         | Number of items this hash table reports having   |
| counted          | Number of items found while walking the table    |
| resized          | Number of times the hash table resized           |
| mem_size         | Running sum of memory used by each item          |
| mem_size_counted | Counted sum of current memory used by each item  |

** Checkpoint Stats

Checkpoint stats provide detailed information on per-vbucket checkpoint
datastructure.

Like Hash stats, requesting these stats has some impact on performance.
Therefore, please do not poll them from the server frequently.
Each stat is prefixed with =vb_= followed by a number, a colon, and then
each stat name.

|                                     | vbucket's state. If an item's value  |
|                                     | is ejected, this stat will be        |

threads is also made available.

The following stats are available for the workers and dispatchers:

| state             | Threads's current status: running, sleeping etc.              |
| runtime           | The amount of time since the thread started running           |

* Details

** Ages

The difference between =ep_storage_age= and =ep_data_age= is somewhat
subtle, but when you consider that a given record may be updated
multiple times before hitting persistence, it starts to be clearer.

=ep_data_age= is how old the data we actually wrote is.

=ep_storage_age= is how long the object has been waiting to be
persisted.

** Warming Up

Opening the data store is broken into three distinct phases:

*** Initializing

During the initialization phase, the server is not accepting
connections or otherwise functional.  This is often quick, but in a
server crash can take some time to perform recovery of the underlying
storage.

This time is made available via the =ep_dbinit= stat.

*** Warming Up

After initialization, warmup begins.  At this point, the server is
capable of taking new writes and responding to reads.  However, only
records that have been pulled out of the storage or have been updated
from other clients will be available for request.

(note that records read from persistence will not overwrite new
records captured from the network)

During this phase, =ep_warmup_thread= will report =running= and
=ep_warmed_up= will be increasing as records are being read.

*** Complete

Once complete, =ep_warmed_up= will stop increasing and
=ep_warmup_thread= will report =complete=.

* Uuid
The uuid stats allows clients to check if the unique identifier created
and assigned to the bucket when it is created. By looking at this a client
can verify that the bucket hasn't been recreated since it was used.
