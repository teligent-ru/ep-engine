 * this. The interface is generally customised for the needs of:
 * - getNextItem and is thread safe as the frontend operations and
 *   DCPProducer threads are accessing this data.
 * - processBufferedItems by the processer task of the consumer
 *
 * Internally a std::queue and std::set track the contents and the std::set
 * enables a fast exists method which is used by front-end threads.
